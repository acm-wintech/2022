            <p align="justify" style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Due to the still significant statutory lockdowns/travel restrictions in-place due to the coronavirus outbreak, and since it is still unclear when the situation will return back to normal, WiNTECH 2021 will be held as a virtual (online) conference. We are going to announce more details of the virtual event soon. Stay safe and healthy!</p>

            <p align="justify">The increasing complexity of the wireless ecosystem witnessed in recent years has prompted an increasing need of experimental validation of innovative wireless solutions and applications and their coexistence. The WiNTECH workshop has been created to deal with all those methodological, technical and policy issues to be faced when defining, running, controlling and benchmarking experiments on wireless solutions. The workshop, now in its 15th edition, intends to bring together academic researchers and industry players working on different aspects of experimental wireless communications and networking. As such, it serves as a forum for sharing experiences and results with real testbeds, experimental evaluation, prototyping and empirical characterization of wireless technologies.</p>

            <p align="justify">The workshop will facilitate discussions on unresolved issues, including new laboratory methodologies, key real-life limitations of wireless technologies that have emerged over the past few years (e.g., mmWave, underwater, 5G, IoT, wearables, and SDN), as well as key challenges facing the wireless networking of the future. As WiNTECH concerns experimental communications and networking, it will feature a relatively large demo session as centerpiece, where real testbeds, deployments and prototypes can be demonstrated and discussed. A demo competition is planned.</p>

            <p align="justify">All the regular papers will be considered for the <b>Best Paper Award</b>.</p>

            <p id="listing" align="justify">In addition to the regular papers, the program of WiNTECH 2021 will also include:</p>
            <li>Keynote speeches from renowned researchers and practitioners</li>
            <li>Demos and posters</li>
            <br>
