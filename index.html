            <p align="justify">The increasing complexity of the wireless ecosystem witnessed in recent years has prompted an increasing need of experimental validation of innovative wireless solutions and applications and their coexistence. The WiNTECH workshop has been created to deal with all those methodological, technical and policy issues to be faced when defining, running, controlling and benchmarking experiments on wireless solutions. The workshop, now in its 15th edition, intends to bring together academic researchers and industry players working on different aspects of experimental wireless communications and networking. As such, it serves as a forum for sharing experiences and results with real testbeds, experimental evaluation, prototyping and empirical characterization of wireless technologies.</p>

            <p align="justify">The workshop will facilitate discussions on unresolved issues, including new laboratory methodologies, key real-life limitations of wireless technologies that have emerged over the past few years (e.g., mmWave, underwater, 5G, IoT, wearables, and SDN), as well as key challenges facing the wireless networking of the future. As WiNTECH concerns experimental communications and networking, it will feature a relatively large demo session as centerpiece, where real testbeds, deployments and prototypes can be demonstrated and discussed. A demo competition is planned.</p>

            <p align="justify">All the regular papers will be considered for the <b>Best Paper Award</b>.</p>

            <p id="listing" align="justify">In addition to the regular papers, the program of WiNTECH 2021 will also include:</p>
            <li>Keynote speeches from renowned researchers and practitioners</li>

            <p align="justify">ACM WiNTECH has advanced to its 15th anniversary as one consolidated tradition for bringing together an important number of researchers and industry players working in different aspects of experimental wireless communications and networking. The workshop will continue to serve as a forum for sharing new ideas and experiences gathered across all experimental aspects of wireless networks and systems, such as the methodological and technical issues that have to be faced for defining, running, controlling and benchmarking experiments on wireless solutions. The workshop will also facilitate discussions of key unresolved challenges and emerging problems in the field, such as new laboratory methodologies, key real-life limitations of current and novel wireless technologies that have emerged over the past few years (including mmWave, 5G, IoT, VLC, wearables, underwater and aerial networking, and SDN), as well as key challenges facing the wireless networking of the future.</p>

            <p align="justify">We are particularly interested in papers describing developments, lesson-learned and new results obtained through platforms for at-scale wireless research such as those in the US NSF Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program, the European 5G-PPP program under the coordination of EMPOWER, technical co-sponsors of the workshop, and of similar programs focused on large-scale experimentation.</p>

	       <p align="justify">We are seeking original, previously unpublished papers empirically addressing key issues and challenges in experimental wireless networking.</p>

We welcome proposals for demonstrations of novel work in wireless network testbeds, measurement platforms and results, and innovative prototypes. The areas of interest overlap those listed in the workshop Call for Papers. The innovations showcased can be at any layer of the protocol stack, from physical to application. However, we particularly encourage demonstrations and posters that span over multiple layers. Wireless networking must be the key topic. Posters may describe work in progress, while the session will offer an excellent opportunity to receive feedback and discuss early research. We emphasize that the demos and posters session is not a forum to display commercial products.</p>
