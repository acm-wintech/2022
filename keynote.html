            <h3>Keynote II</h3>
            <p align='justify'><b>From Massive MIMO to Quantum Computing: A Decade of Discovery by Prototyping</b><br>
            Dr. Lin Zhong, Yale University</p>

            <b>Abstract</b>
            <p align='justify'>Massive MIMO technology employs many antennas and massive computational power to serve many users concurrently, reusing the same spectrum spatially. About a decade ago, we reported the world's first massive MIMO base station prototype, Argos, which helped elevate it to an important technology for 5G. Recently the third generation of Argos has been adopted as a key component by the U.S. Platform for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program and made commercially avialble. This talk shares our experience of building three generations of Argos, our ongoing effort toward commoditizing future wireless infrastructures, and the (surprising) link between wireless and quantum computing.</p>

            <b>Bio</b>
            <p align='justify'>Lin Zhong is Professor of Computer Science with Yale University. He received his B.S. and M.S. from Tsinghua University and Ph.D. from Princeton University. From 2005 to 2019, he was with Rice University. At Yale, he leads the Efficient Computing Lab to make computing, communication, and interfacing more efficient and effective. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award, the Duncan Award from Rice University, and the RockStar Award from ACM SIGMOBILE. He is a Fellow of IEEE.
